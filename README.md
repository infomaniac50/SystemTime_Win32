##Description

This is just a project to help me learn Windows API calls and such. Since I have been doing quite a bit of C with a C++ subset on my Arduino (www.arduino.cc). I figured it would be easy to get into C/C++ programming for Windows. I have done Windows before but not for a long time. So there you go. A project for my own reference posted to GitHub for all to see and for me to hack on as I see fit.
